# 📊 Personal Progress Tracking - User Guide

## How Each Member Can Track Their Own Progress

2. Click on the dropdown that says "Select Your Name"

## 📈 What You Can See

### Personal Statistics (4 Cards)

#### 1. **📊 Total Check-ins**
- Shows how many days you've successfully checked in
- Example: "5" means you've checked in 5 times out of the current day count

#### 2. **🔥 Current Streak**
- Your ongoing streak of consecutive check-ins
- Resets to 0 if you miss a day
- Example: "7" means you've checked in 7 days in a row

#### 3. **🏆 Best Streak**
- Your longest streak ever during this expedition
- This is your personal record!
- Example: "12" means your best run was 12 consecutive days

#### 4. **📈 Completion Rate**
- Percentage of days you've checked in
- Calculated as: (Total Check-ins / Current Day) × 100%
- Example: "85%" means you've checked in 85% of all days so far

## 📅 Personal Calendar View

Below your stats, you'll see a **visual calendar** showing:

### Last 30 Days
- Each box represents one day
- Shows day number and status icon

### Color Coding:
- **✅ Green (Checked)**: You checked in that day - great job!
- **❌ Red (Missed)**: You missed that day - don't worry, get back on track!
- **⏳ Gray (Future)**: Days that haven't happened yet
- **🌟 Gold Border (Today)**: The current day is highlighted

### Hover for Details
- Hover over any day to see: "Day X: Checked in ✅" or "Day X: Missed ❌"

## 🔄 How It Updates

### Real-Time Updates
- When you check in, your stats update immediately:
  - Total Check-ins increases by 1
  - Current Streak increases (or stays the same)
  - Completion Rate recalculates
  - Calendar shows the new check-in
